# Starting simple:

## I believe the earth is round [#1]
Since I believe we have been to space and that our means of astronomical measurement are accurate and sophisticated enough. Space photography shows a round earth, and our satellites wouldn't work if the earth wasn't round

## I believe we have been to space [#2]
The advent of orbital space travel is so intrinsic to our modern technology that without it, many of our day to day devices would not be functional. (Cellphones, gps)

* these two exercise a "trivial" belief whose justification relies on the composition of two compound beliefs

Getting more complicated: digging for contradictory beliefs

## I believe all people regardless of gender, race, sexuality, religion, or beliefs should be treated equally [#3]

Maybe more simply:

I believe all people should be treated equally

I believe it is right for people to farm and eat animals

What makes humans people? Why are those distinctions enough to justify farming?

## I think social media is overall good for society [#4]
I think it increasing the exposure people have to the lifestyles and beliefs of
others will increase the overall empathy that they have for each other [#5]. I think
it outweighs the social negatives of increasing the distribution of narcissism,
and increasing channels for misinformation and negativity.

## I think that increased empathy is good for society [#5]
Increasing the empathy people have for others should help decrease
misunderstanding and decrease judgement of others. Increasing the amount of
people who understand the pain of others should increase how much people are
willing to help each other.
