# Starting simple:

## I believe the earth is round [#1]
Since I believe we have been to space and that our means of astronomical measurement are accurate and sophisticated enough. Space photography shows a round earth, and our satellites wouldn't work if the earth wasn't round

## I believe we have been to space [#2]
The advent of orbital space travel is so intrinsic to our modern technology that without it, many of our day to day devices would not be functional. (Cellphones, gps)

* these two exercise a "trivial" belief whose justification relies on the composition of two compound beliefs

Getting more complicated: digging for contradictory beliefs

## I believe all people regardless of gender, race, sexuality, religion, or beliefs should be treated equally 3

Maybe more simply:

I believe all people should be treated equally

I believe it is right for people to farm and eat animals

What makes humans people? Why are those distinctions enough to justify farming?
