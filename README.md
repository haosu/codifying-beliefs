# Codifying Beliefs

Our beliefs are temporal by nature and most of them are expected to change with
our life experience. But when was the last time you remembered changing a
belief or even established one?

I'd like to track the establishment and changes of my beliefs in addition to
the basic beliefs that compose to form more complicated ones. This repository
will serve as a changelog to my beliefs in addition to the decomposition of
complicated beliefs in to beliefs that inform them.

These beliefs don't have to be some truth about the world or something
profound. They can be small preferences that together make up my personality. I
hope to eventually graph the relationships between these beliefs to find what
base beliefs could 'define' my personality.


## The process

To start I'll be putting these beliefs and their reasoning without
categorization. If explaining a belief requires further justification, then I
will establish a new one, reference, and explain the reasoning.

Commit message should contain information about the circumstances of a belief
change if possible. Justifications should contain the rationale.

Early commits will probably be messy as I establish convention and formatting
for expressing beliefs and justification.

## Interesting bits

At some point two of my beliefs will either contradict or their component
beliefs will contradict and I will need to resolve the conflict.

How atomic should a belief be? At what point does a belief not require
justification?
